# :wave: Covid-19 App (SOEN390) :wave: <br>

## Objective :trophy:

The objective of this project was to build an application that connects COVID-19 patients with doctors and medical professionals. The application allows doctors to easily observe and monitor the status of their patients based on the information the patient provides. Moreover, this project was developed for the Concordia mini-capstone in preparation for the final engineering project capstone. This project allowed us to learn and further develop an understanding of the fundamentals of software development, project management and the overall process of delivering a product.

## Description :pencil2:

The application provides a platform for doctors, health officials, and immigration officers to connect with patients. Initially, users are asked to sign up, provide their personal information and select their roles (patient, doctor, health officials, etc). In order for privileged accounts to be accepted into the system, admins must validate their credentials. Services provided for patients in the system include: daily symptom form uploads, book appointments or direct chat with their doctors, close monitoring by doctors, and access to the latest relevant information related to COVID. Further, services provided for doctors include: analytics of their patients, direct chat with their patients, a dashboard containing all their patients, and patient symptom forms.
